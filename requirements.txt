# Ensure other dependencies are compatible or remove version pins if unsure
# Example: protobuf might have specific version needs with other libs
protobuf>=3.20.0,<4.22.0 # Example of pinning if needed, adjust as per actual compatibility
# For instance, torch 2.3.0 might work well with a more recent protobuf,
# but older Langchain versions sometimes had issues with very new protobuf versions.
# Start without the protobuf pin and add it only if specific errors arise.
